# Aquarium
I made this fun little aquarium simulation where the user can add several different types of creatures and needs to also add food so that they survive.
### Controls
All animals will be spawned in the closest valid location to the mouse location
- `1` to spawn fish
- `2` to spawn crab
- `3` to spawn clownfish
- `4` to spawn rock
- `5` to spawn goldfish
- `6` to spawn turtle

Click anywhere to spawn fish food at that location. Click on rocks to pet them (as everyone knows rocks will die if you don't pet them!).

### Download
Download the respository and you can play the simulation as an application on Windows from the Windows-amd64 folder and on Linux from the Linux-amd64 folder.
